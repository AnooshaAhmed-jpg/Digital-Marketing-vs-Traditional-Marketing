  <h1>Digital Marketing vs Traditional Marketing: Which Works Best?</h1>

  <p>Marketing is the heartbeat of every successful business. But in today’s world, companies are faced with a big question:

    <li>Billboards and posters</li>
    <li>Newspaper and magazine ads</li>
    <li>Flyers and brochures</li>
    <li>Event sponsorships</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It has been around for decades and is still effective for reaching local audiences, building brand credibility, and targeting people who aren’t active online.</p>
