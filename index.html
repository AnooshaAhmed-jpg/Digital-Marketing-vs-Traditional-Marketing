  <h2 style="color:#2c3e50;">‚öôÔ∏è Key Insights You Can Use</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Digital is growing fast, traditional is shrinking</strong><br>
      The trend is strong globally: more companies allocate greater budget % to digital; traditional media (print, TV, billboard) is losing share.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Better ROI, measurability, and optimization</strong><br>
      With digital, you can see immediately what works (Google Analytics, Facebook Insights etc.), adjust, test. Traditional has delays, estimation, and less control.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Cost effectiveness, especially for SMEs and startups</strong><br>
      Digital methods allow smaller budgets yet meaningful results, because targeting is more precise and waste is lower.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Customer behavior supports digital</strong><br>
      People increasingly use search engines, social media, video, and mobile devices. Reports show a large share of consumers start product/brand discovery online. Digital presence influences purchasing decisions even when final sales might happen offline.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Hybrid approach often best</strong><br>
      While digital is dominant, traditional methods still help with brand awareness, reaching offline audiences, credibility, or areas with less internet penetration. Many successful marketing strategies combine both.
